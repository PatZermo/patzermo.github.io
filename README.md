### Some of my work:
- [Phyton](#Phyton-)
- [R](#R-)
- [Visual Basic](#Visual-Basic-)

### Phyton 🐍
- [My Python works repository](https://github.com/PatZermo/python/tree/main)

### R 📊
- [My R works repository](https://github.com/PatZermo/R/tree/main)

### Visual Basic 💾
Soon I will be uploading programs I created several years ago in Visual Basic, the first programming language I learned when I was 12 years old.
